<h3>The Princess Switch</h3>
<p>
  This is a Christmas Hollywood movie that has about three parts. A romantic
  royal movie that entails two princesses that look exactly alike and were
  switched on a baking competition.
</p>
<h3>The Love You Give Me</h3>
<p>
  This is a Chinese drama. A love story between a long-lost girlfriend who later
  became a wife to the young man she once loved and had a son with.
</p>
<h3>Water and Fire</h3>
<p>
  This is a Turkish romantic movie about two people in love who fought for their
  love, but the man gave himself up to save his wife and son. This movie is a
  lovely movie, but at the same time a really sad movie.
