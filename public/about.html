<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'M KELLY VICTORIA AND I'M A WEB DEVELOPER</p>

<p>
  During my second year of college, I remember leaving a lecture feeling
  completely worn out and contemplating my future professional path. In the
  midst of my rest period, an idea to research IT-related jobs suddenly occurred
  to me. During my research, I read about data analysts and became interested in
  becoming one myself someday. However, as time went on, I had the opportunity
  to speak with someone who advised me that in order to become a data analyst, I
  would need to follow a path that would help me get there. Since I had to start
  from scratch, he introduced me to web development. I initially felt that it
  was not what I desired to learn. However, as time went on I decided to learn
  more about it and took courses on it, my interest in it increased and I became
  more enthusiastic about the prospect of learning web development.
